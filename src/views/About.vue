                        I am a young (web) developer from The Netherlands, who is aspiring to become a full stack developer. To the right you'll see the technologies I've worked with.

                        At the moment web development speaks the most to me. But I also am interested in software and game development. Some hobbies include gaming with friends, listening to music and doing weight training. My peers experience me as friendly, enthusiastic and eager-to-learn. I have a hands-on learning approach (learning by doing).

                       In my spare time I like programming and I'm constantly trying to improve myself, including in all facets of life aswell.

                  In my spare time I like to work on a personal project inside Unreal Engine 4. This is when I get the most 'creative pleasure' out of my day, besides working on websites. This also includes modeling in Blender and UE4 itself, blueprinting, and (dabbling) in C++. üòÅ
