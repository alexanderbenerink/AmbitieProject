                            I am a programmer from The Netherlands who is aspiring to one day become a full stack developer in the field of software engineering. In the following section you'll see the technologies I've worked with till so far.

                            I like tinkering with computers, software, websites and game engines. As a career choice I'm interested in working as a software engineer, which includes aspects of software- and webdevelopment from the design phase to post-production.

                           Some hobbies of mine include excercising, hanging with friends, learning how to program, read books and listening to music. My peers experience me as friendly, enthusiastic and eager-to-learn. I find that learning something new through a hands-on approach works the best for me (learning by doing). Every day I'm trying to do something new or productive to push my boundaries and improve.

                      In my spare time I'd like to tinker on projects inside Unreal Engine 4. This also includes using Blender and modeling in UE4 itself, blueprinting, and messing with C++. üòÅ
