                        I am a simple code monkey from The Netherlands who is aspiring to one day become a full stack developer in the field of software engineering. In the following section you'll see the technologies I've worked with till so far.

                        I like tinkering with computers, software, websites and game engines. As a career choice I'm interested in working in the field of software engineering, which includes aspects of software- and webdevelopment (from the design phase to post-production).

                       Some hobbies of mine include excercising, hanging with friends, learning how to program, read books and listening to music. My peers experience me as friendly, enthusiastic and eager-to-learn. I find that learning something new through a hands-on approach works the best for me (learning by doing). Every day I'm trying to do something new or productive to push my boundaries and improve.

                  In my spare time I like to work on a personal project inside Unreal Engine 4. This is when I get the most 'creative pleasure' out of my day, besides working on websites. This also includes modeling in Blender and UE4 itself, blueprinting, and (dabbling) in C++. üòÅ
